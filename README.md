\# 🚀 Fast Matrix Multiplication: Sequential vs Parallel



\## 📌 Overview



This project compares the performance of matrix multiplication using both \*\*manually written\*\* and \*\*AI-generated\*\* implementations in sequential and parallel modes. Execution times are recorded and visualized using plots.

\## 🧠 Theory (Brief)



Matrix multiplication is computationally expensive for large matrices.



\* In the \*\*sequential approach\*\*, all computations are done by a single process.

\* In the \*\*parallel approach\*\*, the work is divided among multiple processes, where each process computes a subset of rows.



This reduces execution time and demonstrates the practical use of OS concepts like process creation, synchronization, and workload distribution.

\## ▶️ Compilation \& Execution



```bash id="c1a22"

gcc fastmulpar.c -o fastmulpar

gcc fastmulsequencial.c -o fastmulsequencial

gcc fastmulparallel.c -o fastmulparallel

gcc fastmulser\_ai\_seq.c -o fastmulser\_ai\_seq

```



```bash id="c1a23"

./fastmulpar

./fastmulsequencial

./fastmulparallel

./fastmulser\_ai\_seq

```



Run `plot.ipynb` to generate performance graphs from the recorded timing results.

\## 📊 Output



\* Time measurements are stored in text files generated by each program.

\* `plot.ipynb` reads these files and produces comparison plots.
