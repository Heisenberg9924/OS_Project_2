# 🚀 ***Fast Matrix Multiplication: Sequential vs Parallel***

## 📌 ***Overview***

This project compares the performance of matrix multiplication using both ***manually written*** and ***AI-generated*** implementations in ***sequential*** and ***parallel*** modes.
Execution times are recorded and visualized using plots.

## 📁 ***Files Included***

### 🛠️ ***Manual Implementations***

* ***fastmulpar.c*** – Parallel matrix multiplication using multiple processes (`fork`)
* ***fastmulsequencial.c*** – Sequential matrix multiplication
* ***myHeader.h and myHeader2.h*** – Contains the necessary header files used in the main code.

### 🤖 ***AI-Generated Implementations***

* ***fastmulparallel.c*** – Parallel matrix multiplication
* ***fastmulser_ai_seq.c*** – Sequential matrix multiplication

### 📊 ***Visualization***

* ***plots.ipynb*** – Generates performance comparison graphs using output data files from time.txt and timeseq.txt.

## 🧠 ***Theory (Brief)***

Matrix multiplication is computationally expensive for large matrices.

* ***Sequential Approach:*** All computations are done using a single process.
* ***Parallel Approach:*** Work is divided among multiple processes, where each process computes a subset of rows.

This helps reduce execution time and demonstrates OS concepts like process creation, synchronization, and workload distribution.

## ▶️ ***Compilation & Execution***

```bash
gcc fastmulpar.c -o fastmulpar
gcc fastmulsequencial.c -o fastmulsequencial
gcc fastmulparallel.c -o fastmulparallel
gcc fastmulser_ai_seq.c -o fastmulser_ai_seq
```

```bash
./fastmulpar
./fastmulsequencial
./fastmulparallel
./fastmulser_ai_seq
```

Run ***plots.ipynb*** to generate performance graphs from the recorded timing results.

---

## 📊 ***Output***

* Time measurements are stored in text files generated by each program.
* ***plot.ipynb*** reads these files and produces comparison plots.
